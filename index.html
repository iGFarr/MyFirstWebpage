        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <!--&nbsp for spaces. thanks google :D-->
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Isaac Farr. I am from Maryville, TN, and I just finished 
           my Associate of Science at PSCC. Now I am working through Thinkful's coding bootcamp
           so that I can progress my career to the next level! </p>

        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aside from my interest in coding, I am quite inarguably a nerd at heart.
            This is pretty obviously reflected in how I spend my free time. I would say my 3 favorite 
            hobbies in order are:
        </p>
        
        <!--ordered list with a class that adds padding to indent the list-->
        <ol id="hobbies" class="indent">
            <li><p>Rubik's Cubes</p></li>
            <li><p>Studying Calculus and Watching Videos on Unsolved Theorems</p></li>
            <li><p>3-D Modeling and Printing</p></li>
        </ol>

        <!--subheaders with elaboration on my hobbies-->
        <h3>Rubik's Cubes</h3>
        <p>When I'm not at work or working on my coding bootcamp coursework, Rubik's cubes
            and other twisty puzzles occupy A LOT of my time. I just started in January, but I now average
            about 25 seconds on 3 x 3, and have a collection of over 80+ puzzles.</p>

        <h3>Calculus</h3>
        <p>One of the hardest things about deciding to do this bootcamp instead of going on
            to a university, is that I am not in Calc 3 this semester. I absolutely love math, 
            and I plan to learn as much as I possibly can.
        </p>    

        <h3>3-D Printing</h3>
        <p>I learned how to do 3-D modeling with solidworks last year, and my brother surprised me with
            my first 3-D printer. I immediately started pumping out simple objects, and before long I decided
            to upgrade to an IDEX capable printer, and have produced some really cool stuff since then!</p>
